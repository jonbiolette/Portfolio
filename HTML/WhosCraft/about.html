                I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan but am now living on the West Cost of the United States. Rather
                than calling myself an “artist”, I prefer to call myself an art-lover. I enjoys doing arts and crafts,
                but digital art is one of the main mediums I use.
                I believe digital art is the most cost-effective medium and allows me to learn new skills and create my
                own work in an efficient way anytime and anywhere I would like! I admire creative, exquisite, and
                inspiring artwork, and I hopes to someday create something like those masterpieces.

                Besides doodling, I am not afraid to challenge myself and draw subject matter I am not familiar with.
                Although, it may take me a while, I do believe in pain and gain, practice makes you perfect. I value
                every one of your opinions and suggestions related to the artworks, it is not only the fuel that
                motivates me, but also the indicator that directs us on the right path. If there is anything you would
                like to share of if you are looking for a chance to cooperate, please do not hesitate to send a message
                via the “Contact” page or direct message me on Instagram!

                Taiwan is a small country located off the coast of China. It is famousefor how friendly our citizens
                are, our cuisine, and our night markets! We have convient public transporation system that gets you
                anywhere you want to be on the island easily. One of the popular tourist activities is traveling the
                entire island and seeing all of the monuments around the country since we are a smaller country it is
                easy to see everything in one trip.
