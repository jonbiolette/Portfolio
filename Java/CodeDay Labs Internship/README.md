About the project
Every day, people stand around asking each other "Where are we going for lunch?" Shouldn't there be an app for that? 
Create an app to find (using google maps api) local restaurants, allow the user to pick as many as they like, 
put them in a list, then randomly select one when the user enters the app or taps a button. If time permits: keep a 
log of which were selected and prevent reselection of recent ones link to directions to the selected restaurant 
track personal ratings of the choices.
